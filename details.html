        <p>How long have vampires been around? There are stories of vampire-like creatures from as early as ancient Greece! This centuries-old monster is said to be undead, meaning they are animated and act similar to a living human, but with no actual vitality. They survive by draining the living of their bodily fluid, primarily blood, by way of biting their victims with sharp, snake-like teeth. 

        Sunlight will burn a vampire's skin, so they are active mostly at night. There are times that they can be active during the day, as long as the weather permits. This is why storms, mist and cloudy days contain a sense of foreboding. You never know what you could encounter when the sun isn't out! 
            
        According to lore, their downfalls are crosses, silver and garlic, and can be extinguished by stabbing them in the heart with a wooden stake. To be safe though, it would work best to decapitate them.</p>
